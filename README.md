# Computer Organization üñ•Ô∏è

This project implements a simulator, assembler, and assembly test programs for the SIMP processor, a simplified version of the MIPS processor. Completed as part of a Computer Organization course.

## Components:
- **Simulator:** A C-based program simulating fetch-decode-execute loop and I/O devices. It offers a virtual environment for executing SIMP processor instructions, aiding in understanding CPU operation. The simulator generates output files that facilitate comprehensive analysis of the executed code.
- **Assembler:** C-based program translating assembly code to machine code. It facilitates the conversion of human-readable assembly instructions into binary machine code.
- **Assembly Test Programs:** Four programs testing various processor functionalities. These programs are designed to validate the correctness and efficiency of the simulator and assembler components.

## Aim üéØ:
The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in computer organization principles, including processor architecture, assembly language programming, and simulation techniques.

## Usage üöÄ:
Please refer to the project documentation for detailed instructions on compilation, execution, and further explanations.
